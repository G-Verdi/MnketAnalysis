Subject 4534 in condition Ketamine was exposed to the tone sequence saved in 
workdir/tones/textfiles/ketamine/sub4534.txt, this sequence was extracted into 
workdir/subjects/ketamine/MMN_4534/tones/tones.mat and regressor trajectories were constructed 
simulating the Bayes optimal agent. Simulation is saved in sim struct and the final regressors in 
design.mat, all in the subject's model folder. 

EEG recording for this subject was started too late, i.e., starting at the 29th tone (therefore only
 1812 event triggers in EEG, as compared to 1840 in the tone sequence files).

We can verify that it is the FIRST 28 trials by comparing the tone sequence saved in the sub4534.txt
 file and the sequence of event triggers in the initial (unprocessed) EEG file. 

Additionally, the first event can not be extracted because the baseline of 100ms would start before 
the EEG recording. We therefore end up with 1811 trials in the EEG, which is 29 less than in the 
behavior.

We assume the subject nevertheless heard all tones and therefore simulated the belief trajectories 
using the full sequence. For EEG analysis, however, the regressors have to be shortened to fit the 
EEG data.

We remove:

1) the first 29 entries from the tones vector which is used in the redefinition of trials according 
to our standard/deviant definition in the classical ERP analysis. The final tones vector will be 
saved as eegtones.mat.

2) the first 28 entries from the PE traces from the simulation which are saved in the design files 
for each and are used for the modelbased GLMs of EEG on the first level. We only need to remove 28 
entries, because the modelbased regressors have one trial less (the first tone) than the EEG files 
anyway. Here, we remove the entries from the [designOption]_design.mat file. In the final 
[designOption]_design_eeg.mat, which we use in the GLM, we have also removed the trials that got 
lost in the EEG due to artefact rejection during preprocessing.
