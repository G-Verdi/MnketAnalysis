This readme describes the way we deal with the first trial of the tone sequence in the MNKET study.

In this study, we model how participants infer on transition probabilities between the 7 different 
tones they were exposed to. The first tone therefore has no update or prediction error with it, as 
the first observation of a transition only occurs with the second tone.

In the modeling, we therefore start the model only at the second tone. The first tone is however 
saved in the r.u_orig field and also used to define the first transition in the main loop over 
trials (in the file tapas_hgf_transition).

In the modelbased EEG analysis, we can either:
- append our trace of PE estimates with one 'dummy' value in the beginning (e.g., repeat the second
entry) - this should not lead to changes of a meaningful size in our results, as it affects only 1 
trial out of ~1700. 
- remove the first EEG trial from the final preprocessed EEG file, as we cannnot assign a meaningful
value to this trial from the modeling perspective. In this case, we first need to check whether the
first trial has anyway been removed already due to artefacts, and if not, we mark it as bad before 
the conversion to images.

Up to Jan 30, 2018: option 1. From then on: we choose option 2, as it is more principled.
