Subject 4458 in condition Ketamine has an additional tone trigger event in the EEG data:

type: 'STATUS'
value: 3
duration: []
time: 0.0020
offset: 0

along with the regular first trigger events signalling the start of the session:

type: 'Epoch'
value: []
duration: []
time: 0.0020
offset: 0

type: 'CM_in_range'
value: []
duration: []
time: 0.0020
offset: 0

type: 'Epoch'
value: []
duration: []
time: 0.0020
offset: 0

We assume that this is an 'overspill' of a previous Matlab experiment and does not constitute an 
actual trial. We assume the first actual trial is marked as the 4th trigger event in the EEG:

type: 'STATUS'
value: 1
duration: []
time: 3.2129
offset: 0

This is also in line with the textfile containing the tone sequence for this session. 

Therefore, we remove this incorrect trial from the EEG data set during the preprocessing using the
function: mnket_remove_incorrect_first_trial.m.

We end up with an initial number of trials of 1842 in the EEG, corresponding to 1842 tones in the 
textfile, and 1841 transitions (i.e., trials in the modelbased regressors).
